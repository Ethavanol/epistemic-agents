- Tests are currently out-of-date but implementation is working (prioritizing implementation completion for deadline)

The epistemic reasoner used by these agents can be found at: https://github.com/MikeVezina/epistemic-reasoner

Once running, set the reasoner HOST field in `epistemic-agents/src/main/java/epistemic/reasoner/ReasonerSDK.java` to connect to the reasoner.
